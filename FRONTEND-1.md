## Video Submission

- Create a video submission. (YouTube private video, shared by link, works well for video submission for this class.)  Video submissions should be less than 2 minutes long and follow this scenario:
  1. Off-screen, deploy your IDM microservice and mini-frontend on your local device. Do not include this part in the video.
  2. Open your security-disabled browser and open a network panel (CTRL+SHIFT+J on Windows, or COMMAND+OPTION+J on Mac). Keep this panel open as you continue with the following steps.
Navigate to your website.
  3. Try to log in using an unregistered username and password. (It should report that log in fails.)
  4. Next, register a new user (e.g., with login panteater@uci.edu and a password of your choice).
  5. Log in using the user you just registered (e.g., panteater@uci.edu). (It should indicate that the log in worked.)
- Submit a link to your video on the corresponding Canvas assignment.
